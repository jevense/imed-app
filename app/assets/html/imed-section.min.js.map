We established our “Huaxi Experience” with our core measures of residency training programs. Our core measures include endorsement from the department leadership, detailed curriculum, requirement of the duration of each rotation, mentor-trainee system, dedicated clinical teaching faculty position, and 4-step resident evaluation system (daily, monthly, annual, final). The implementation of the core measures plays important roles in quality assurance. We conclude that the detailed curriculum, education and training policies, evaluation and feedback system are crucial for quality assurance of the residency training programs.\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"maga-keyword en\">\n        <strong>Key words : </strong>Residency training program; Quality assurance; Core measures\n      </div>\n    </header>\n    <article>\n      <section>\n        <h3 class=\"mag-title-lv1\">1&nbsp;制度建设</h3>\n        <div>\n          <span class=\"mag-title-lv2\">1.1  招录制度</span>\n          <p>\n            人才是卫生事业发展的第一资源，是深化医药卫生体制改革的重要支撑。为培养高质量的卫生人才，四川大学华西医院（华西医院）从2000年开展以社会人身份招收应届毕业生进行规范化培训（规培）[1]，经过17年不断探索实践，已建立起一套较完整的住院医师规培体系。目前已培训社会人身份的住院医师1 727人，外单位委培住院医师1 187人，农村订单定向免费生规培62人。本研究对华西医院在住院医师规培制度建设、严格管理、质量保证体系建设等进行分析与研究，现报道如下。</p>\n          <p>\n            人才是卫生事业发展的第一资源，是深化医药卫生体制改革的重要支撑。为培养高质量的卫生人才，四川大学华西医院（华西医院）从2000年开展以社会人身份招收应届毕业生进行规范化培训（规培）[1]，经过17年不断探索实践，已建立起一套较完整的住院医师规培体系。目前已培训社会人身份的住院医师1 727人，外单位委培住院医师1 187人，农村订单定向免费生规培62人。本研究对华西医院在住院医师规培制度建设、严格管理、质量保证体系建设等进行分析与研究，现报道如下。</p>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n    </article>\n    <footer>\n      <!--作者相关信息-->\n    </footer>\n  </main>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n\n  export default {\n    name: 'imed-magazine',\n    props: ['section'],\n    data () {\n      return {\n        sections: {}\n      }\n    },\n    methods: {\n      defaultName (name = '') {\n        return !name ?

Our core measures include endorsement from the department leadership, detailed curriculum, requirement of the duration of each rotation, mentor-trainee system, dedicated clinical teaching faculty position, and 4-step resident evaluation system (daily, monthly, annual, final).
